# Modern Coordinate Modification and Verification System

## Introduction

Modern Coordinate Modification and Verification System (MCMVS) is a modern rewrite of the Coordinate Modification and Verification System (CMVS) written by my father from 1988 to 1993. The original version was written in C for the DOS operating system, and leveraged the graphics mode of DOS to visualize 3D points and lines.

This version is written in C using SDL2, built on an M2 Arm Macbook Pro.
